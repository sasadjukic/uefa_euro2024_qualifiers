<strong>ABOUT</strong><br>
<br>
This repo covers data from UEFA Euro2024 Qualifiers. Not sure what will I eventually do with this but I will keep updating the datasheet and decide later. All data from official UEFA stats page that you can find at https://www.uefa.com/european-qualifiers/

<strong>NOTES</strong><br>
<br>
One thing I noticed is that UEFA does not consider a penalty to be a "clear chance" in a football(soccer) game. One thing you'll see in this sheet is a game having a penalty but stats for "clear chances" will have 0 for both home and away teams...
